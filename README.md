# HDR Camera
A HDR camera app that can take multiple photos with different exposure times and merge them into one single HDR image.
## Guidance
Copy the app-release.apk file in app folder to your Android Phone and install it.

Or you can download and install Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to open it.
First you need to clone it from git:

In Android Studio, you can import existing project that you have cloned from git
